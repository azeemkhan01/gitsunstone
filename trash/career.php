                Sunstone Program is an important period of transition that prepares 
                students to create and leverage opportunities in future. Sunstone 
                program is only relevant for students if it makes a lasting impact 
                on their career and that’s how we measure the success of program. 
                Once the students have built solid academic foundation at Sunstone, 
                it’s important to start taking steps towards their career aspirations.

                Students who join our program are looking to find more business-centric 
                roles to put their learning from this program to use. It’s a two-step process:

                Building aspirations: Before you set some goals for yourself, it’s 
                important to get the exposure and broaden your horizon. Most of our 
                students are mature and they do not want to jump to a career before 
                understanding the nuances. At Sunstone, job of our Career Coaching team 
                is to act like mentors and work individually with students to identify 
                right career goals for them. Any kind of career transition takes time 
                so it’s important to understand the ground realities and be passionate 
                before trying for it.

                 Creating opportunities: We continuously create opportunities to educate 
                the industry about our program and our students. Thus, we are generating 
                placement opportunities in the industry for our students depending on 
                their aspirations. Career Coaching team works with students not only to

                The output of Sunstone program is not measured by answering a 
                binary question- did you change your role after the program or not? 
                It has a long term impact on your career and we measure our success 
                by what are you doing after 4-5 years of the program. Sunstone 
                association is a lifelong association and you create skills and 
                networks that are useful for entire span of your career. You may even 
                identify opportunities and convert them at a later stage of your career.

                Lot of professionals and entrepreneurs are involved with Sunstone for

                to know them and meet them. They love to mentor the students if you can 
                reach out to them with serious intent and energy.

                As a result of these efforts, our students have found some outstanding 
                roles in the industry, some through our opportunity creation efforts, 
                some through their own applications and some by upgrading their jobs 
                in their existing companies.
