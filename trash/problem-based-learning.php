              <p>Sunstone has embraced “Problem Based Learning” pedagogy, an approach in research for over 20 years and adopted at
                Stanford, Ohio and various other colleges. ‘Problem Based Learning’ is based on the belief that concepts can be learnt
                and retained well only when they are approached under the context of a real business problem as opposed to theory or
                short case based learning.

                <p>We take real world business problems from the technology industry to students and help them learn management
                concepts in the process of solving them.</p>
                <p>A typical module flows is represented below:</p>
<!--               <p>
                The basis of Sunstone PGPM is learning experientially, similar to the way we learn at work.
                 There are two ways in which we make this happen – firstly, by following a problem based 
                 learning pedagogy and secondly, by following a strong peer collaboration approach to 
                 learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                We take real world problem situations to small groups of students and impart management
                concepts in the course of solving them. This is very similar to how one learns on the job,
                and enables you to apply your learning at work at once. The problems are focused around 
                key business areas that a business manager should be well versed with. The faculty in this method 
                assumes the role of a coach and guide vs. traditional lecturing.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have embraced a “Problem Based Learning” curriculum, an approach in research for over 
                20 years and adopted at Stanford, Ohio and various other colleges. It is a bigger, broader 
                canvas than a “case” to paint on. While a typical case is designed for 1-2 hours of 
                classroom participation, a problem can span weeks. The pedagogy’s focus is on “being > 
                applying > knowing” rather than the traditional “knowing > applying > being”, with a 
                strong belief that it will impart the right combination of execution and management 
                skills to create future leaders for the industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every module is divided into multiple courses with specific learning objectives. 
                A course comprises of a core business problem, assignments, reference study material, 
                online class discussions and web based tutorials.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, we meet the students through a contact day format at least once a 
                month. This day is used for student networking, workshops, industry networking and 
                some parts of curriculum delivery.
