<meta property="og:description" content="Since time immortal, humans have absorbed information and wisdom from others by means of stories. Whether sitting around the campfire, planning a battle, or jockeying in the board room, stories wield the power to influence our thoughts and emotions in ways that logic and facts rarely can.
