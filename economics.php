               We live in a world of scarce resources. Yet how well we utilize these resources depends on day-to-day decisions that we make. The economic concept of “supply and demand” helps us understand the decisions of others and ourselves. In this module, students learn the basics of sound decision-making by examining choices and scarcity and appreciating how trade creates value for both parties through the principles of ‘comparative advantage’ and ‘free trade’. 
                <br><br>
               Students learn to take better decisions for their business, their society and themselves.

                  <p>Course has given me a big insight into the decisions made by senior leaders in company. Cost Vs Benefit analysis is not only helping me in my professional life, but also in my personal life. It has positively impacted my key decisions. Comparative analysis and opportunity cost - Learning these concepts for first time and practical application of those are turning out to be very fruitful.</p>

                  <p>I never imagined this one course will have such a profound impact on how i evaluate and decide on financial choices around. I come from engineering/technology background and I initially thought that learning economics would be very boring. But it turned out to be an engaging, thought provoking and fun learning experience. Application of simple principles like comparative advantage, cost benefit analysis and opportunity cost on real life situations during the course have helped me become more economic savy. I am now able to appreciate why certain business decisions are taken and how an entrepreneur can benefit by being more aware of irrational choices around and take more sound financial decisions by avoiding some common pitfalls.</p>
