                          <p>Due to the sheer number of people spread across large organizations, business leaders rarely get the luxury of controlling anything directly. Instead they cluster, delegate, motivate and empower teams of people to get things done. Hence organization structure becomes the most basic tool of the Chief Executive.In this course, students develop familiarity with the organization designer’s toolkit and how to interpret and understand their companies structural elements.

In this course, we explore the fundamentals of storytelling as it applies to communication in the corporate context. Students learn to synthesize what they have to say and articulate it in the right sequence for their audience to understand.
