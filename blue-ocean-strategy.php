                When an organization offers an undifferentiated product or service in a crowded market, the competition can be fierce. Pricing and volume come under pressure as closing each sale becomes more and more difficult. Some liken this situation to a “red ocean” in which sharks get so excited by the smell of blood that they begin to feed on each other. 
                <br><br>
                In this course, Students discover firsthand the effectiveness of value innovation as opposed to the more traditional competitive and retaliation-driven business strategies.
