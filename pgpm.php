                            <p>In a desperate attempt to improve performance, today’s organizations have unleashed a tsunami of lean/six sigma improvements, IT projects, HR initiatives, etc. Most new initiatives are never actually implemented, but even those that ARE often fail to create much value. Yet external and internal customers demand us to somehow demonstrate the “business value” of our activities…
                               <br><br>In this module, students learn how to work out the business value of individual tactics and gauge their attractiveness for the organization as a whole through:

                            <p>Since time immortal, humans have absorbed information and wisdom from others by means of stories. Whether sitting around the campfire, planning a battle, or jockeying in the board room, stories wield the power to influence our thoughts and emotions in ways that logic and facts rarely can. In this course, we explore the fundamentals of storytelling as it applies to communication in the corporate context. Students learn to synthesize what they have to say and articulate it in the right sequence for their audience to understand.

                                <p>Many of the historic financial scams involved direct manipulation of the top line. This should come as no surprise given it’s sensitivity to subjective assumptions. Note that the performance metrics and bonuses of many decision makers rely on revenue as the most variable factor. Hence “how to account for revenue” crops up as a perennial issue at the highest levels.

                            <p>When should a company issue shares to raise money, and when should it issue debt? Equity is usually considered to be more “expensive” than debt, but in bad times it can really come in handy. Debt payments are far less forgiving and failure to make payments can trigger legal action and even bankruptcy proceedings.

                            <p>When an organization offers an undifferentiated product or service in a crowded market, the competition can be fierce.
