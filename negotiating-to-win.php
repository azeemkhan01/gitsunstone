               Whether pushing for a higher increment with your boss or managing the expectations of a demanding customer, negotiation is an indispensible skill in your personal and professional life. Negotiations tend to be stressful and unavoidable whenever there is more than one stakeholder involved. Left unresolved, these conflicts can become major roadblocks for effective business decision-making.
                <br><br>
               Students become aware of the wide range of negotiation techniques and how these are used to work out win-win outcomes.

                  <p>Undergoing this course has helped me structure my thoughts in terms of how to negotiate at a B2B level. This course has broadened my perspective, as now I know how to initiate the conversations and go for a winning negotiation. Discussions over case studies were really very amazing. The approach to make small teams or assigning partners was actually the best part as I was able to do live negotiations in small teams.</p>

                  <p>I always believed that negotiation is very important in any dealing, but wondered how to go about it. This course helped me to learn different types of negotiations and the strategies required to handle them. I came to understand the importance of First Offer (Anchoring effect), BATNA (Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement), LAS (Least Acceptable Solution) and MSP(Most Supported Points) in any negotiation. Best part of learning was case-study based multiple practice sessions.</p>
