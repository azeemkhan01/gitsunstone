              Growth is critical for businesses to create value. Considered as the primary driver of share prices, the effects of Growth go well beyond the mere financial. It energizes the whole organization and thus helps attract and retain talent. It builds reputation among customers and suppliers. If a business does not grow, it tends to get left behind.

               Students develop as “Smart Generalists” who are prepared to solve fundamental business problems with an aim to achieve growth.

                  <p>The Growth Strategies-1 course was really superb. I was never aware of the SPI , Market reports, Product reports. This course really helped to get a better vision on these factors. Now if I think of starting my own business then I do not need spend much time in the scratch work as that I have already learned here along with an awesome team, nice team work. My role in this assignment was to  take care of the R&D hence I was more into market analysis and product analysis.
